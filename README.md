# bioinformatics-project

This project was made for the class SCC0606 - Data Structures II from the University of Sao Paulo (ICMC-USP). The idea was to study and apply asymptotic analysis of algorithms while contextualizing them with a real-world application, in this case, searching for the most active gene in genomic data.

Function headers and code comments were written in portuguese due to the university project nature of this program.
